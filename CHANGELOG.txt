=== 0.6.3 :: 2007-03-14

* Fixed bug in mongrel postamble that prevented the server from starting when
  the log level was set to DEBUG.

=== 0.6.2 :: 2007-03-06

* Fixed some loading problems having to do with the new CAS authenticator
  introduced in 0.6.0.

=== 0.6.1 :: 2007-02-28

* Fixed bug introduced in 0.6.0 where webrick and mongrel postambles were
  broken for apps that don't define any public directories.
* Each public directory mount is now logged during startup. Also resolved
  some potential issues with the uri_path config option. Multiple /'s
  in the path are now automatically removed.

=== 0.6.0 :: 2007-02-26

* Added support for CAS authentication. See picnic/authentication.rb for 
  details.
* Webrick and Mongrel can now be made to bind to a specific IP address using
  the :bind_address option. If no :bind_address is specified, the server will
  listen on all addresses (i.e. '0.0.0.0').
* The Public controller for serving the '/public' directory is gone. It has
  been replaced by respective Webrick and Mongrel mechanisms for serving
  directory contents, since these are much faster. If you're using CGI/FastCGI,
  you'll have to manually configure your web server (i.e. probably Apache)
  to serve your public directory contents.
* The gem package now correctly recognizes markaby as a required
  dependency.

=== 0.5.0 :: 2007-12-20

* First public release.
