=== 0.6.0 :: 2007-02-26

* Added support for CAS authentication. See picnic/authentication.rb for 
  details.
* Webrick and Mongrel can now be made to bind to a specific IP address using
  the :bind_address option. If no :bind_address is specified, the server will
  listen on all addresses (i.e. '0.0.0.0').
* The Public controller for serving the '/public' directory is gone. It has
  been replaced by respective Webrick and Mongrel mechanisms for serving
  directory contents, since these are much faster. If you're using CGI/FastCGI,
  you'll have to manually configure your web server (i.e. probably Apache)
  to serve your public directory contents.
* The gem package now correctly recognizes markaby as a required
  dependency.

=== 0.5.0 :: 2007-12-20
